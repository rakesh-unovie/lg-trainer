# Feature Specification: Alpha Channel and Resizing Support

**Feature Branch**: `004-alpha-channel-and-resizing-support`
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Some images can contain alpha channels but still be solid background ones. We will have to take this into consideration. Also rembg internally resizes the image to 320x320 so we will have to train the model in such a way."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Model training handles images with alpha channels (Priority: P1)

As a data scientist, I want to train the logo detection model with images that have alpha channels, so that the model can accurately process a wider variety of input images.

**Why this priority**: This is critical for model robustness and accuracy, as many real-world images may contain alpha channels.

**Independent Test**: The training pipeline can be run with a dataset containing a mix of images with and without alpha channels. The model's performance can be evaluated on a hold-out test set.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a dataset containing images with alpha channels (both solid and semi-transparent backgrounds), **When** the training process is initiated, **Then** the process completes without errors.
2. **Given** a trained model, **When** it is evaluated on a test set of images with alpha channels, **Then** the performance is comparable to its performance on images without alpha channels.

### User Story 2 - Model training accounts for image resizing (Priority: P1)

As a data scientist, I want the training process to account for the 320x320 resizing performed by `rembg`, so that the model is trained on images that are representative of the pre-processing pipeline.

**Why this priority**: The model must be trained on data that reflects the production pre-processing steps to ensure accurate predictions.

**Independent Test**: The image loading and pre-processing steps of the training pipeline can be inspected to confirm that images are resized to 320x320.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a dataset of images with varying dimensions, **When** the images are loaded for training, **Then** they are all resized to 320x320 pixels.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an image with an alpha channel has a complex, non-solid background?
- How does the system handle corrupted images or images with invalid alpha channel data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST identify images that contain an alpha channel.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST handle images with solid alpha backgrounds as standard images.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST convert images with semi-transparent backgrounds to a solid white background.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST resize all images to 320x320 pixels before they are used for model training.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: The model's F1 score on a test set of images with alpha channels is within 5% of the F1 score on a test set of images without alpha channels.
- **SC-002**: The training pipeline successfully processes 100% of valid images, including those with various types of alpha channels, without errors.
